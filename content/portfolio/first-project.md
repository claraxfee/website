## About

In my first year with the WHRC Radio Club on my campus, I helped to design and create their home page website. This website was the first web design project I ever took on. I worked collaboratively with the Radio Club founders to implement a user-friendly and easily navigatable interface to help build listenership and encourage people to join the club. 

## Timeline and scope 
I worked on this project for most of the school year in my free time. Since its completion, I've made occasional changes and updates, including adding new posts for our events such as the 100th anniversary of WHRC. 

## Skills and technologies
For ease of use, both in future maintenence and development, I used Wordpress with some additional customization via CSS.
