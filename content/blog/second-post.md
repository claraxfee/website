Here are two poems. They were both written as submissions for the Bat, my living cooperative's semi-regular zine.

The first, *Future_Ism*, was written for an edition of the zine for which the theme was "future". The second, *STANDING AND NOT SITTING*, was written for a zine themed "anger".

Future_Ism

Sometimes I feel that I want to build a RADICAL FUTURE. Other times that feels hopeless and I want to preserve this money-life while I still can.

Everyone is secretly rich. It is illegal to laugh and it is a burden to be here. My complexes have complexes. The pearls of wisdom are littering the floor but I have no basket with which to pick them up. I feel bad but not bad enough.

I feel good but not good enough. I think about a RADICAL FUTURE. Are you still there, God? It’s me, Margaret. When I was a child my father told me that our family cat went to heaven. Then the next day he said that, actually, nobody knows what happens after anybody dies, including the cat. I was spitting howling mad. 

I am financially non-catastrophic. In fact I am quite financially sustainable. What if I had a trust fund? Would it make me a better person? Will my mother work until she keels over, eighty-six and decrepit, on the job? I want to buy my mom a house. It feels centering, like meditation. I have a binary perception of nothing, hand-to-God-on-my-momma, except for everything about myself and my abilities and my body and my clothing choices. I want to establish a regime. I want to start over from scratch and do it right this time. Nobody can call themselves anything.

When the last terrible evil figure in my life told me he wanted to run away to a cabin in the woods and never speak to anyone ever again I was spitting mad. For me it is hard to sympathize with inability.

What happens if my body gives out? I want a RADICAL FUTURE. I can’t even imagine myself less a couple square inches of flesh. It’s impossible for me to un-tether myself from Google Calendar. I know that it’s possible because other people tell me so.

Maybe I will run away to a cabin in the woods and never speak to anyone ever again and shave my head. I do not think it would help.

STANDING AND NOT SITTING

One  

I am at my worst when I am thinking of myself as an angry person, when I am doing anger. 

Two  
I feel most angry, most potently, when I am confronted with incompetence, empty authority, helplessness, unfairness and (most deeply and potently of all) injustice; I feel it physically and quickly,
down the body,
lumped together with a shock behind the eyelids and a burning through the esophogus. 

Three  
There was a line in a poem I wrote a long time ago: "For me, it is hard to sympathize with inability."
I struggle iwth anger because the thing towards which I am angry, mostly---
by simple majority---is myself---
---my orientation is selfwards, too often. 
So much---most?---of my external anger is externalized anger, and I often regret its expression.

Four  
Not always, though.

Five
I am not at my worse, but perhaps not at my best either, when I accept and allow the anger. 
Just how they teach you to do with your thoughts when you meditate---
---observe the thought, observe how the act of observation changes its shape, and allow its passage through. 
Just how I have never been able to do with any of my thoughts at all.

Six
I am getting a little bit angry writing this. 

Seven
Lucky number seven. So where is all my anger?
There seem to be plenty of outlets for it now. More than there ever have been, if soem are to be believed. 
At best, it's low simmering and calm; at best, it's standing and not sitting.
At best it's quieting the fear to stone. 
I think deeply about things; most things, even, though I can't claim they are the right ones. 
I try to remain a serious person.
I try not to let the foot-stomping bitter-teared older sister, childish in her cry, demanding uncritical fairness towards especially her, pull too much weight.
I try instead of lay myself, ten toes down, heavy and grateful.
