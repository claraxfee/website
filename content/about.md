Hi there! I'm Clara Fee. Thanks for being here. 

I'm a Computer Science and Spanish double major at Bryn Mawr College (Class of 2026), with a minor in Film Studies. I want to build technology that amplifies underrepresented voices and makes digital spaces more accessible.

## What I Do

I care about technology and social impact, user experience, social computing, and good design. My work spans web development, digital humanities, nonprofit logistics and fundraising, and community organizing. I believe technology should serve communities, not just markets; I'm particularly interested in how we can use tech to improve digital literacy, better our collective experiences online, and create more equitable systems.

Currently, I'm:
- **Station Manager @ WHRC Radio**, managing our college radio station and building digital infrastructure for student broadcasters
- **CS Teaching Assistant**, helping students master data structures and algorithmic thinking
- **IT Help Desk Student Manager** (3.5 years), where I've developed deep expertise in troubleshooting, user education, and cross-platform support
- **Budget Manager @ Batten Haus Living Cooperative**, where I manage our semesterly and yearly budget, coordinate our fundraising efforts, and fight for sustainability and environmental justice 

## What I've Built

My projects reflect my commitment to thoughtful, human-centered technology. See my portfolio [here](https://clarafee.xyz/portfolio/)

- **Digital humanities research** with the [Ticha Project](https://ticha.haverford.edu/), creating digital archives for Indigenous Zapotec languages
- **Community websites** for campus organizations, prioritizing accessibility and ease of maintenance
- **Technical tools** like image processing algorithms 
- **Database-driven web applications** combining front-end design with robust back-end architecture

I'm fluent in Spanish and have experience working across cultures—skills that inform how I think about inclusive design and international collaboration.

## What I'm Looking For

I'm seeking early career or newgrad fulltime roles, especially in (but not limited to) **New York City**, that combine my technical skills with my passion for social impact. I'm particularly drawn to:

- **Smaller companies and startups** that need a "swiss army knife", move fast, and operate hands-on
- **Educational technology** that improves digital literacy and learning outcomes for underserved communities
- **Nonprofits and mission-driven organizations** using technology to address social challenges

## When I'm not programming, you'll find me:
- Hosting my weekly radio show, Wednesdays 5-6 at [whrc-radio.com](whrc-radio.com)
- Watching films and thinking about how visual media shapes culture
- Living in an environmentally conscious co-op, where I've learned that the best solutions come from collaborative problem-solving
- Writing about technology, internet culture, politics, and cooking [[blog]](clarafee.xyz/blog)
