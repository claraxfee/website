Hi there! I'm Clara Fee. Thanks for being here.

I'm a soon-to-be-newgrad Computer Science and Spanish double major at Bryn Mawr College ('26) with a minor in Film Studies. I want to build technology that amplifies underrepresented voices and makes digital spaces more accessible.

### what I do:

I care about technology and social impact, user experience, social computing, and good design. My work spans web development, digital humanities, nonprofit logistics and fundraising, and community organizing. I believe technology should serve the people; I'm particularly interested in how we can use tech to improve digital literacy and better our collective experiences online.

### what I've built:

My projects reflect my commitment to thoughtful, human-centered technology. See my portfolio [here](https://clarafee.xyz/portfolio/)

- **Digital humanities research** with the [Ticha Project](https://ticha.haverford.edu/), creating digital archives for Indigenous Zapotec languages
- **Community websites** for campus organizations, prioritizing accessibility and ease of maintenance
- **Technical tools** like image processing algorithms
- **Database-driven web applications** front-end design with back-end architecture

I'm fluent in Spanish and have experience working across cultures; these skills inform how I think about inclusive design and international collaboration.
