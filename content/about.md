Hello, and thank you for being here! 

My name is Clara Fee. I'm a junior at Bryn Mawr College; my majors are Computer Science and Spanish with a minor in Film Studies. 

I'm interested in a wide variety of things: web development and web design, computer graphics and computer vision, ethics in AI/machine learning, graphic design, digital media studies, and Spanish language and literature.
